Hello everyone this folder is totally dedicated to 
internship
I recently got oppourtunity to work with X-workz Rajainagar Banglore,
doing so will be learning about front end web development and related technologies like HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP,JS,and Github for version control

html defines the structure of the web applicstion.
css used to add colors style and position html elements.
github is used for multiple collaborators working on a same project makes it easy to monitor and track changes.
bootstrap is used for ready made css to be used with html tags by including their class name
javascript is a clirnt side scripting language used to make our webpage dynamic
